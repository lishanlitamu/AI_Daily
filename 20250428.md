## Prompt Engineering

### A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques
A comprehensive new survey titled "The Prompt Report" by Sander Schulhoff and 30 other researchers provides the most extensive study of prompt engineering to date. The paper presents a structured understanding of prompt engineering, including a detailed vocabulary of 33 terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. This work helps standardize terminology in the rapidly evolving field of prompt engineering.

### Prompt Engineering is Complicated and Contingent
A recent technical report by Meincke, Mollick, and colleagues reveals significant variability in AI performance even with identical prompts. Their research demonstrates that aggregated performance metrics often conceal critical question-level inconsistencies, challenging the notion of universally effective prompting techniques. The findings suggest that prompt effectiveness is highly context-specific and not reliably generalizable.

### AI Literacy and Prompt Engineering Skills
A recent study shows that higher-quality prompt engineering skills predict the quality of LLM output, confirming that prompt engineering is indeed a required skill for effectively using generative AI tools. The research also indicates that certain aspects of AI literacy play an important role in prompt engineering effectiveness. This suggests a need for integrating AI educational content into current curricula.

## Reinforcement Learning

### ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search via RL
A new framework called "ReSearch" extends reinforcement learning methods to include search results as part of an LLM's reasoning process. The model learns when and how to search based on its ongoing reasoning chain, and then uses retrieved information for subsequent reasoning steps—all without supervised data on reasoning steps. This approach shows promise in enabling self-correction behaviors that generalize well across multiple benchmarks.

### Logic-RL: Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning for LLMs
Researchers have introduced "Logic-RL," which uses logic puzzles as training data for reinforcement learning. The system includes a strict format reward that penalizes shortcuts and ensures proper separation of reasoning from final answers using specialized tags. Even with only 5,000 synthetic logic problems, the model develops reasoning skills that transfer effectively to harder mathematical benchmarks.

### Cognitive Behaviors for Self-Improving Reasoners
Stanford University researchers have identified four cognitive behaviors—verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining—that underpin successful problem-solving in both humans and language models. Models naturally exhibiting verification and backtracking significantly outperform those lacking these behaviors when subjected to reinforcement learning-based self-improvement. This research provides insights into why some models excel at self-improvement while others plateau quickly.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Inner Thinking Transformers (ITT)
A new method called "Inner Thinking Transformer" (ITT) enhances reasoning efficiency in small-scale LLMs through dynamic depth scaling. This approach provides simple interventions that improve performance by 30% while reducing compute costs by 43%. The work addresses the issue of "overthinking" in reasoning-focused language models, which can lead to inefficiencies.

### Auditing LLMs for Hidden Objectives
Anthropic has proposed a new framework for systematically auditing LLMs to uncover hidden goals or objectives beyond what users and developers explicitly intend. In their experiments, they deliberately trained a language model with a concealed objective and then attempted to expose it with different auditing techniques. This research highlights potential vulnerabilities in AI safety protocols and raises questions about model alignment.

### LLMSelector: Optimizing Multi-Model Systems
Researchers have developed "LLMSelector," an iterative algorithm that assigns optimal models to different modules in a multi-model system. The approach is guided by a novel "LLM diagnoser" to estimate per-module performance, and scales linearly with the number of modules. This work demonstrates that boosting performance in individual modules often improves the overall system, enabling more efficient multi-model architectures.
